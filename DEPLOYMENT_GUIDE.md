# CryptoPipeline Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Summary

Your project is now ready for deployment! Here's what was fixed:

### ✅ Issues Resolved
- **Fixed refresh API**: Now calls backend API instead of trying to run Python locally
- **Removed pmdarima dependency**: This package had build issues with Python 3.13
- **Switched to Python 3.11**: Better compatibility for deployment
- **Added Railway configuration**: Proper deployment settings for backend
- **Fixed GitHub Actions**: Using official CLIs instead of broken third-party actions

### 📋 Deployment Steps

#### 1. Deploy Backend to Railway First

```bash
cd pipeline

# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway up

# Note the deployed URL (e.g., https://your-app-name.railway.app)
```

#### 2. Update Frontend Environment Variables

In `dashboard/.env.local`, update:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-actual-railway-url.railway.app
```

#### 3. Deploy Frontend to Vercel

```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
vercel login
vercel --prod
```

#### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

**Railway Backend Environment:**
- `DB_HOST`: Your Supabase database host
- `DB_NAME`: Your database name
- `DB_USER`: Your database user
- `DB_PASS`: Your database password
- `DB_PORT`: 5432

**Vercel Frontend Environment:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anon key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`: Your Railway backend URL

### 🔄 How the Refresh Works Now

1. **User clicks refresh** in dashboard (Vercel)
2. **Frontend calls** `/api/refresh-data` (local Vercel function)
3. **API calls backend** `https://your-backend.railway.app/refresh-data`
4. **Backend runs** Python pipeline (Railway with Python environment)
5. **Results returned** to frontend and displayed

### 🛠 Automated Deployment Setup

Your GitHub Actions workflows are ready! Add these secrets:

**Frontend secrets:**
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Your Vercel API token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Your Vercel organization ID  
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Your Vercel project ID

**Backend secrets:**
- `RAILWAY_TOKEN`: Your Railway API token

### 🧪 Testing the Fix

After deployment, test the refresh:

1. Go to your deployed dashboard
2. Click the refresh button
3. Check browser console for logs
4. Should see: "Triggering data refresh via backend API..."

### 🎯 Architecture Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Frontend handles UI, backend handles ML
- **Scalability**: Backend can handle heavy ML workloads
- **Reliability**: Background task processing with status updates
- **Free Hosting**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend) free tiers

All issues have been resolved and your deployment architecture is now production-ready! 🎉
